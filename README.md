# SVM Algorithm 

**Overview**

## This Python script uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) for the classification of medical images into two categories: with tumor (tumor) and without tumor (no_tumor). The script includes functions for image loading, preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, validation, testing, and visualization of results. 

You can find more detailed project information in the attached **PDF 'Automatic Tumor Detection_VÄƒdana Ioan-Grigore'**.

**Requirements**

Python 3.x

- Libraries: numpy, scikit-image, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

**Features**

- Image Preprocessing: Converts images to grayscale, resizes them to 256x256, and normalizes pixel values.

- Data Preparation: Loads images from specified directories, labels them, and splits them into training, validation, and test sets.

- Data Standardization: Standardizes the data using StandardScaler from scikit-learn.

- SVM Model: Trains an SVM classifier with a linear kernel.

- Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve.

- Visualization: Visualizes confusion matrix, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve using matplotlib and seaborn.

- Image Display with Predictions: Displays images with predicted labels.

**Usage**

- Place your dataset in two separate folders, one for tumor and another for no_tumor images.

- Update the folder paths in the script: tumor_images, tumor_labels = load_images_from_folder('path_to_tumor_images', 1) and no_tumor_images, no_tumor_labels = load_images_from_folder('path_to_no_tumor_images', 0).

- Run the script to train and test the SVM model on your data.

**Functions**

- load_and_preprocess_image(image_path): Loads and preprocesses a single image.

- load_images_from_folder(folder, label): Loads all images from a given folder with a specified label.

- display_image_with_label(image, label): Displays an image with its predicted label.

**Notes**

- The script assumes images are in JPEG format. Modify the load_images_from_folder function if your dataset is in a different format.

- The paths in load_images_from_folder need to be updated to match your dataset's location.

**Disclaimer**

- The performance of the model depends on the quality and size of the dataset. This script is intended for educational purposes and may require adjustments for production use.
